Socrates, the founder of the western philosophic tradition, was executed on charges of "corrupting the youth." Ever since then, students and teachers of philosophy are travelers in his wake, such that Alfred North Whitehead characterized the tradition as nothing but mere "footnotes to Plato," with Socrates being the protagonist in Plato's work.

As a teacher of philosophy, there is something that seems quite right about the idea of "corrupting" our students. 

- Against cultural indoctrination, we teach critical thinking
- Opposed to conformity, we teach the value of truth
- Rather than arguing about conclusions, we teach the questioning of premises
- In a world concerned with marketable skills, we teach that the unexamined life is not worth living
- Not content merely to seek out knowledge, we teach the love of wisdom

To the uninitiated, a student of philosophy may very well appear "corrupted:" unwilling to accept "common sense," asking questions that others do not, and choosing reality over appearance. But we know that this way of thinking, these skills, are valuable for *life*, and this *includes* being valuable to potential employers and business endeavors while going beyond mere marketable skills.

This website is a place for those of us who teach philosophy to help one another do our jobs better in order to help our students gain the philosophical skills that transcend technical value.

## About Me, Matt Cleaver

In 2004 I began publishing my thoughts on working within my professional field (which at the time was church youth ministry). I found the practice to be extremely helpful in my personal and professional development. Even if no one ever read my thoughts, articulating my thoughts in writing forced a clarity that would otherwise be missing. By publishing my thoughts in public, I was able to glean feedback and thoughts from colleagues on how to get better at my chosen profession. 

Now, over a decade later, I am in a new field as I embark on a career teaching philosophy, and I again seek the professional development provided by publishing my thoughts and hosting a conversation about the unique pedagogical challenges within philosophy. I hope you will join the conversation.

I am an adjunct instructor at Trinity Valley Community College in Athens, Texas, which means I am primarily interested in the challenges faced while teaching lower-division philosophy courses to community college students that are usually taking my classes in order to fulfill a core curriculum requirement. However, I welcome input from those who teach upper-division courses and graduate students.
